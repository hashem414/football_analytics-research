## Project Overview
Modern football analytics often depends on expensive tracking systems and high-quality event data, which are not available for many regional leagues.  
In this project, we build a **computer vision pipeline** that generates match analytics directly from **broadcast video** of the Jordanian Pro League.

The pipeline focuses on:
- Detecting players, goalkeepers, referees, and the ball
- Tracking objects over time (multi-object tracking)
- Assigning players to teams using jersey appearance cues
- Estimating ball possession at player and team levels
